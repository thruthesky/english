# Domain and ID matching



if domain in address bar is


igoodtalk.com       then, the domain should be "igoodtalk.onlineenglish.kr"
iamtalkative.com    then, domain is '' "talkative.onlineenglish.kr"

witheng.com         then, domain is ''
onfis.com           then, domain is ''


If domain is not one of above, then, translate

"ID@" plus "first part of the domain" plus ".onlineenglish.kr"

if the first part is 'www', then apply the second part.

for instance, if domain is "www.abc.co.kr", then the translated would be "ID@abc.onlineenglish.kr"


Sample ID: mgonkim of "www.iamtalkative.com"
Sample ID: italk2 of "www.iamtalkative.com"

test id: testboy pw:0000
testboy@talkative.onlineenglish.kr
